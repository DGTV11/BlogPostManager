# Portfolio generator

## Description
TL;DR -> this locally hosted flask app will essentially take in your achievements, details, etc and make you a portfolio website for those who are too lazy to make it themselves (like Daniel, who is too lazy to update his github pages website) ðŸ™‚

### Primary template:
1) Name
2) Profession (e.g. student)
3) Achievements + Skills
4) Contact details
5) Links to Github/socials (will ALWAYS be on sidebar ig like https://sawntoe.github.io)

### Extra control:
1) Styling control (e.g. colour pallete, font size, font)
2) Users can make their own Categories (e.g. writeups, projects) with body `<article>`s (or separate article pages) with headings and multiple subheadings,with body texts

### Output
It will give users a single HTML file or multiple html & css files in single directory (idk depends on the scope of the project)
