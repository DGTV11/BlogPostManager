# Blog Post Manager

## Description
**TL;DR:** This locally hosted Flask app will allow you to manage your GitHub Pages blog posts and automatically push the entire blog (essentially the entire website) to GitHub.

### Primary Details (on Sidebar/About):
1. **Name**
2. **Profession** (e.g., student)
3. **Contact Details** (optional)
4. **Links to GitHub/Socials** (will always be on the sidebar, like [this website](https://sawntoe.github.io))

### Extra Control:
1. **Styling Control:** Options to customize the color palette, font size, and font.
2. **Categories:** Users can create their own categories (e.g., writeups, projects) with `<article>` elements or separate article pages, including headings, multiple subheadings, and body text.

### Output:
- **Auto-Pushes to GitHub:** Automatically updates your GitHub Pages site.
- **Raw Website Files:** Provides the raw website files for manual deployment.
